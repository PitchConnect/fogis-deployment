Clean up repository: remove debug artifacts, migrate Loki, add infrastructure

This comprehensive cleanup reorganizes the repository, removes temporary
debugging artifacts, migrates Loki to Docker volumes, and adds production-ready
infrastructure for automated deployments and testing.

## Repository Cleanup (Step 1)

### Files Deleted (61 total)
- 13 Python debug/test scripts (force_sync_match_*.py, subscriber_fix_*.py, etc.)
- 2 shell scripts (apply_subscriber_fix.sh, direct_force_sync.sh)
- 6 configuration variants (ci_updated.yml, pyproject_*.toml, etc.)
- 2 test images (enhanced_schema_logo_test.png, team_db_id_logo_test.png)
- 35 investigation reports (temporary AI-generated debugging documents)
- 3 additional documentation files (implementation guides, planning docs)

### Files Organized (13 total)
- Moved fix_calendar_sync.sh → scripts/diagnostics/calendar-sync-diagnostic.sh
- Moved 8 permanent docs → docs/
- Moved 3 architectural docs → docs/architecture/
- Moved 1 operational doc → docs/operations/

### Directories Created
- scripts/diagnostics/ - Diagnostic and troubleshooting tools
- docs/ - General documentation
- docs/architecture/ - Architectural decision records
- docs/operations/ - Operational guides and runbooks

## Loki Docker Volume Migration (Step 2)

### Changes
- Migrated Loki data from ./monitoring/loki/ to Docker named volume
- Updated docker-compose.yml to use fogis-loki-data volume
- Cleaned up hundreds of Loki runtime files from repository
- Updated .gitignore to prevent future tracking of Loki data

### Benefits
- Loki data no longer tracked by Git
- Reduced repository size significantly
- Proper data management for monitoring infrastructure
- Easier backup and restore with Docker volumes

## Infrastructure Files Added (Step 3)

### GitHub Workflows
- .github/workflows/auto-update-images.yml
  * Automated container image update workflow
  * Pulls and verifies new images from GHCR
  * Runs smoke tests on new images
  * Creates PRs to track image updates
  * Production-ready with comprehensive error handling

### Cloudflare Worker
- cloudflare-worker/webhook-handler.js
  * Webhook handler for GitHub package events
  * Verifies webhook signatures (HMAC SHA-256)
  * Triggers auto-update workflow via repository_dispatch
  * Production-ready but not yet deployed
- cloudflare-worker/wrangler.toml
  * Worker configuration with environment separation
  * Placeholder values for account ID and domain
- cloudflare-worker/README.md
  * Deployment instructions and documentation
  * Architecture overview and troubleshooting guide

### Test Infrastructure
- tests/ - Complete integration test suite
  * Redis pub/sub workflow tests
  * Service health and connectivity tests
  * Mock FOGIS API for isolated testing
  * Docker Compose test environment
  * Comprehensive README with usage examples
  * CI/CD ready with JUnit XML output

### Documentation
- CLEANUP_GUIDE.md - Repository cleanup instructions
- LOKI_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md - Loki Docker volume migration guide
- REPOSITORY_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md - Cleanup summary and overview
- cleanup-repository.sh - Automated cleanup script

## Configuration Updates

### .gitignore
- Added Loki monitoring data patterns
- Added test artifacts and cache patterns
- Prevents tracking of runtime data and build artifacts

### docker-compose.yml
- Updated Loki service to use named volume
- Added fogis-loki-data volume definition
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing services

## Impact

### Repository Health
- Removed 61 temporary/debug files
- Organized 13 documentation files
- Clean separation of concerns
- Improved discoverability of documentation

### Infrastructure
- Production-ready automation workflows
- Comprehensive test suite for CI/CD
- Webhook integration ready for deployment
- Proper data management for monitoring

### Maintainability
- Clear documentation structure
- Reusable diagnostic tools
- Architectural decision records preserved
- Test infrastructure for ongoing development

## Verification

All changes have been tested:
- ✅ Cleanup script executed successfully
- ✅ Loki migrated and verified working
- ✅ Infrastructure files reviewed and validated
- ✅ .gitignore patterns tested
- ✅ Documentation complete and accurate

## Next Steps

1. Review and merge this commit
2. Optional: Deploy Cloudflare Worker for automated webhooks
3. Optional: Integrate tests into GitHub Actions CI/CD
4. Monitor Loki for 24-48 hours to ensure stability
