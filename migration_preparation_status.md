## Container Image Strategy

### üèóÔ∏è **Current Approach (Production Ready)**
```yaml
# Using local patches with full event-driven architecture
match-list-change-detector:
  build:
    context: local-patches/match-list-change-detector
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.patched
  environment:
    - RUN_MODE=service
    - CRON_SCHEDULE=0 * * * *

match-list-processor:
  build:
    context: local-patches/match-list-processor  
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.patched
  environment:
    - RUN_MODE=service
```

### üöÄ **Future Approach (After Upstream Merge)**
```yaml
# Using published images with standardized components
match-list-change-detector:
  image: ghcr.io/pitchconnect/match-list-change-detector:v2.0.0
  environment:
    - RUN_MODE=service
    - CRON_SCHEDULE=0 * * * *

match-list-processor:
  image: ghcr.io/pitchconnect/match-list-processor:v2.0.0
  environment:
    - RUN_MODE=service
```

### üì¶ **Migration Timeline**

| **Phase** | **Timeline** | **Status** | **Actions** |
|-----------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| **Phase 1: Local Patches** | Current | ‚úÖ **ACTIVE** | Production deployment ready |
| **Phase 2: Upstream Review** | 1-2 weeks | ‚è≥ **IN PROGRESS** | GitHub issues under review |
| **Phase 3: PR Creation** | 2-3 weeks | üîÆ **PLANNED** | Create PRs after issue approval |
| **Phase 4: Published Images** | 3-4 weeks | üîÆ **FUTURE** | Transition to standardized images |
