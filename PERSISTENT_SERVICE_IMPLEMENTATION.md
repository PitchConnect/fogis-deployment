# Match List Change Detector - Persistent Service Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the persistent service mode for the match-list-change-detector, which transforms it from a problematic restart-loop pattern to a robust long-running microservice.

## Problem Solved

**Before**: The service ran in oneshot mode, completing its task and exiting, causing Docker to restart it every ~60 seconds. This created:
- ❌ Confusing "Restarting (0)" status in service monitoring
- ❌ Failed health checks (no HTTP server)
- ❌ Inability to receive manual triggers
- ❌ Poor operational visibility

**After**: The service runs continuously with an HTTP server and internal cron scheduling:
- ✅ Clear "Up (healthy)" status
- ✅ Working health checks at `/health`
- ✅ Manual trigger capability via `POST /trigger`
- ✅ Configurable cron scheduling
- ✅ Proper monitoring and metrics

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The implementation adds a persistent service mode alongside the existing oneshot mode:

```python
# Service modes
RUN_MODE=oneshot  # Original behavior (run once and exit)
RUN_MODE=service  # New persistent mode with HTTP server
```

### Key Components

1. **HTTP Server** (FastAPI):
   - `GET /health` - Service health and status
   - `POST /trigger` - Manual execution trigger
   - `GET /status` - Detailed service information

2. **Internal Cron Scheduler**:
   - Uses `croniter` library for cron pattern parsing
   - Configurable via `CRON_SCHEDULE` environment variable
   - Default: `0 * * * *` (hourly execution)

3. **Service State Management**:
   - Tracks execution count and timestamps
   - Maintains next scheduled execution time
   - Graceful shutdown handling

### Configuration

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
match-list-change-detector:
  environment:
    - RUN_MODE=service
    - CRON_SCHEDULE=${MATCH_DETECTOR_CRON_SCHEDULE:-0 * * * *}
    - HEALTH_SERVER_PORT=8080
    - HEALTH_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
```

```bash
# .env
MATCH_DETECTOR_CRON_SCHEDULE=0 * * * *  # Hourly execution
```

### Health Check Response

```json
{
  "service_name": "match-list-change-detector",
  "status": "healthy",
  "run_mode": "service",
  "cron_schedule": "0 * * * *",
  "last_execution": "2025-07-14T19:11:23.628903",
  "next_execution": "2025-07-14T20:00:00",
  "execution_count": 1,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-14T19:11:32.270506"
}
```

## Files Modified

### Local Patches Created
- `local-patches/match-list-change-detector/app_persistent.py` - Main persistent service implementation
- `local-patches/match-list-change-detector/match_list_change_detector.py` - Core change detection logic
- `local-patches/match-list-change-detector/config.py` - Configuration management
- `local-patches/match-list-change-detector/Dockerfile.patched` - Enhanced Dockerfile

### Configuration Updates
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated service configuration
- `.env` - Added `MATCH_DETECTOR_CRON_SCHEDULE` variable

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Operational Excellence**:
   - Clear service status in monitoring
   - Proper health checks for load balancers
   - Manual trigger capability for debugging

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Configurable scheduling without code changes
   - Support for complex cron patterns
   - Easy integration with monitoring systems

3. **Industry Alignment**:
   - Follows standard microservice patterns
   - Compatible with Kubernetes health checks
   - Proper HTTP-based service discovery

## Testing

### Manual Testing Performed
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:9080/health

# Manual trigger
curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/trigger

# Service status
curl http://localhost:9080/status
```

### Validation Results
- ✅ Service runs continuously without restarts
- ✅ Health checks respond correctly
- ✅ Manual triggers execute successfully
- ✅ Cron scheduling works as expected
- ✅ Change detection logic unchanged

## Future Improvements

1. **Automated Testing**:
   - Unit tests for service logic
   - Integration tests for HTTP endpoints
   - Cron scheduling tests

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Prometheus metrics integration
   - Structured logging
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Configuration Validation**:
   - Cron pattern validation on startup
   - Environment variable validation
   - Configuration schema

## Migration Path

### For Production Deployment
1. **Option A**: Keep local patches (immediate)
2. **Option B**: Submit PR to upstream repository (recommended)

### Upstream Contribution
The implementation is ready for contribution to the match-list-change-detector repository:
- Clean, well-documented code
- Backward compatible (oneshot mode preserved)
- Production-ready architecture
- Comprehensive error handling

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully transforms the match-list-change-detector from a problematic restart-loop service to a robust, production-ready microservice that follows industry best practices while maintaining full backward compatibility.
