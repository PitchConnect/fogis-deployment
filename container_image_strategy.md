# Container Image Strategy for FOGIS System

## ‚úÖ Current Status: Service-Owned Images Architecture (COMPLETE)

**Migration Complete**: We have successfully transitioned to a **service-owned images architecture** where each service repository builds and publishes its own Docker images.

### ‚úÖ Published Images in Production Use
All services now use published images from GitHub Container Registry:

- `ghcr.io/pitchconnect/match-list-processor:latest` - Full event-driven architecture
- `ghcr.io/pitchconnect/fogis-calendar-phonebook-sync:latest` - Complete Redis integration
- `ghcr.io/pitchconnect/team-logo-combiner:latest` - Production-ready service
- `ghcr.io/pitchconnect/google-drive-service:latest` - Enhanced monitoring
- `ghcr.io/pitchconnect/fogis-api-client-python:latest` - Robust API client

### ‚ùå Local Patches Removed
- ~~Local copies of service source code~~ (Removed)
- ~~Local build infrastructure~~ (Removed)
- ~~Patch management overhead~~ (Eliminated)

## ‚úÖ Architecture Benefits Achieved

### Service-Owned Images Advantages
1. **Faster Deployments**: No local builds required - pull pre-built images
2. **Consistent Environments**: Same images across dev/staging/production
3. **Reduced Complexity**: Deployment repo only contains orchestration
4. **Better CI/CD**: Each service manages its own build pipeline
5. **Automatic Updates**: Dependabot manages image version updates

### Enhanced Features Preserved
All enhanced features from local patches are now available in published images:
- ‚úÖ **Event-driven architecture** with Redis pub/sub integration
- ‚úÖ **Persistent service modes** for continuous processing
- ‚úÖ **Advanced health monitoring** with detailed status reporting
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready error handling** with retry mechanisms
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging** with structured output

## Container Image Versioning Strategy

### Current Local Builds
- **Tag Strategy**: `local-build-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- **Build Trigger**: Manual or on configuration changes
- **Registry**: Local Docker daemon only

### Future Published Images
- **Tag Strategy**: Semantic versioning (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, v2.0.0)
- **Build Trigger**: Automated on merge to main branch
- **Registry**: GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)

### Version Mapping
| **Feature** | **Local Patch** | **Future Published** |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Persistent Service Mode | ‚úÖ Available | v2.0.0+ |
| Event-Driven Processing | ‚úÖ Available | v2.0.0+ |
| Health Check Fixes | ‚úÖ Available | v1.1.0+ |
| Webhook Integration | ‚úÖ Available | v2.0.0+ |

## Migration Preparation Checklist

### Pre-Migration Validation
- [ ] Verify upstream issues are reviewed and approved
- [ ] Confirm PRs are created and under review
- [ ] Test local patches against latest upstream main branch
- [ ] Validate all functionality works with current configuration

### Migration Readiness Criteria
- [ ] Upstream PRs merged to main branch
- [ ] New container images published to GHCR
- [ ] Images tagged with appropriate version numbers
- [ ] All architectural improvements included in published images
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained

### Migration Execution Plan
1. **Update docker-compose.yml**:
   ```bash
   # Replace build contexts with image references
   sed -i 's/build:/# build:/' docker-compose.yml
   sed -i 's/context:/# context:/' docker-compose.yml
   sed -i 's/dockerfile:/# dockerfile:/' docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. **Add image references**:
   ```yaml
   image: ghcr.io/pitchconnect/match-list-change-detector:v2.0.0
   image: ghcr.io/pitchconnect/match-list-processor:v2.0.0
   ```

3. **Test migration**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml pull
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

4. **Validate functionality**:
   ```bash
   # Test event-driven architecture
   curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/trigger
   curl -s http://localhost:9082/health | jq '.mode'
   ```

### Rollback Plan
If published images don't work as expected:

1. **Immediate rollback**:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 docker-compose.yml
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build
   ```

2. **Verify local patches still work**:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:9080/health | jq '.status'
   curl -s http://localhost:9082/health | jq '.mode'
   ```

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements
Before transitioning to published images:

1. **Functional Testing**:
   - [ ] Event-driven processing works correctly
   - [ ] Webhook integration functions properly
   - [ ] Health monitoring provides accurate status
   - [ ] All service dependencies are healthy

2. **Performance Testing**:
   - [ ] Resource usage remains optimized
   - [ ] No unnecessary restart cycles
   - [ ] Processing only occurs when changes detected
   - [ ] Response times meet requirements

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - [ ] End-to-end pipeline functions correctly
   - [ ] All 6 services integrate properly
   - [ ] Backup/restore system works with new images
   - [ ] Monitoring and alerting function correctly

### Acceptance Criteria
Published images must provide:
- ‚úÖ **Feature Parity**: All local patch functionality
- ‚úÖ **Performance Parity**: Same resource efficiency gains
- ‚úÖ **Stability Parity**: Same or better reliability
