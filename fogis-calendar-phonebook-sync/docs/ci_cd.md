- Tagged releases (`v*`)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Process:**
1. **Version Generation:**
   - Tagged releases: Use tag version
   - Main branch: `main-YYYYMMDD-SHA`
   - Develop branch: `dev-YYYYMMDD-SHA`

2. **Docker Build & Push:**
   - Multi-platform support ready
   - GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
   - Comprehensive tagging strategy
   - Build cache optimization

3. **Environment Notifications:**
   - Development: Auto-deploy notifications
   - Production: Manual approval required

**Image Tagging Strategy:**
- Semantic versioning for releases
- Branch-based tags for development
- SHA-based tags for traceability
- Latest tag management

### 5. Docker Build Workflow (`docker-build.yml`)

**Purpose:** Validates Docker image building without publishing.

**Use Cases:**
- Pull request validation
- Build verification
- Dockerfile testing

### 6. Auto PR Develop to Main Workflow (`auto-pr-develop-to-main.yml`)

**Purpose:** Automated pull request creation from develop to main branch when all tests pass.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `develop` branch
- Completion of Tests and Code Quality workflows on develop

**Features:**
- **Smart Test Validation:** Waits for all required workflows to complete successfully
- **Automated PR Creation:** Creates PRs from develop to main when tests pass
- **Conflict Detection:** Checks for changes between branches

**Purpose:** Additional pull request management and tracking capabilities.

**Features:**
- **Status Tracking:** Monitors PR status and test results
- **Notification System:** Alerts for manual intervention when needed

## Branch Strategy & Gitflow Integration

### Branch Structure
- **`main`:** Production-ready code
- **`develop`:** Integration branch for features
- **`feature/*`:** Feature development branches
- **`hotfix/*`:** Emergency fixes for production

### Develop-First Workflow
1. **Feature Development:** `feature/xyz` → `develop`
2. **Automated Testing:** All workflows run on develop
3. **Automated PR Creation:** develop → main when tests pass (via auto-pr-develop-to-main workflow)
4. **Human Review:** Required approval for main branch merges
5. **Automated Merge:** Optional after approval
6. **Production Deployment:** Triggered after main branch updates

### Automated PR Creation Process
The `auto-pr-develop-to-main` workflow streamlines the develop→main promotion:
- **Triggers automatically** when tests pass on develop
- **Creates detailed PRs** with commit summaries and test status
- **Prevents duplicate PRs** by updating existing ones
- **Requires human approval** maintaining quality control
- **Provides clear visibility** into what's being promoted

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests:** Fast, isolated component testing
- **Integration Tests:** End-to-end system validation
- **Nightly Tests:** Comprehensive multi-environment testing

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum coverage thresholds enforced
- Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov
- Trend tracking and regression detection

### Test Execution Rules
- **Never skip unit tests** in CI/CD pipelines
- Integration tests run on branch pushes only
- Nightly tests provide comprehensive validation
- Failed tests block deployments

## Code Quality Standards

### Linting Configuration
- **Flake8:** Primary linting tool
- **Black:** Code formatting (100 character line length)
- **isort:** Import sorting with black profile
- **Bandit:** Security scanning

### Pre-commit Integration
- Local hooks match CI configuration
- Automatic formatting on commit
- Early issue detection
- Consistent development experience

### Quality Gates

## Docker & Container Management

### Image Registry
- **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):** Primary registry
- **Public access:** Images available for deployment
- **Retention policies:** Automatic cleanup of old images

### Image Retention Policy
To manage storage costs and maintain a clean registry:
1. **Navigate to repository settings** → Packages
2. **Configure retention policy** for the container package:
   - Keep last 10 versions of tagged releases
   - Keep last 5 versions of main branch images
   - Keep last 3 versions of develop branch images
   - Delete untagged images after 7 days
3. **Manual cleanup:** Use `docker image prune` commands for local cleanup

### Build Optimization
- **Multi-stage builds:** Optimized image sizes
- **Build caching:** GitHub Actions cache integration
- **Layer optimization:** Efficient Docker layer management
